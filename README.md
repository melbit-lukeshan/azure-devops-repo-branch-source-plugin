# Azure DevOps Repo Branch Source plugin for Jenkins

This project is a mix of GitHub Branch Source plugin for Jenkins and Team Foundation Server plugin for Jenkins.

We try to mimic GitHub Branch Source plugin's functionality but with Azure DevOps as the repository provider.

Most of the source come for GitHub Branch Source plugin and a small part come from Team Foundation Server plugin.
